            <h3 class="Introduction">1.Introduction</h3>
            <p class="p">1.1 This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure
                of User
                information collected on the Site and the Tools. The aim of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand
                how your personal information is used and your choices regarding said use. By using the Site or the Tools,
                you agree that the Foundation can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this
                Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and the Tools, and not to any other websites,
                products or services you may be able to access or link to via the Site or the Tools. We encourage you to
                read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.

                The Site and the Tools may evolve over time, and this Privacy Policy will change to reflect that evolution.
                If changes are made, you will be notified by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In some
                cases, if significant changes are made, an statement may be placed in the homepage. We encourage you to
                review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed.

                Some third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in
                device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of
                cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default,
                but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to
                remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the Site or the Tools might be affected.

                1.2 This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use. By accessing the Tools, you are
                consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.

                1.3 Your use of the DCL Client and any personal information you provide through the Tools remains subject to
                the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, as each may be updated from time to time.

                1.4 Any questions, comments or complaints that you might have should be emailed</p>
            <h3 class="h3">2. Information Collected in the Site and the Tools</h3>
            <p class="p">The personal information collected from you generally may include:

                2.1 Network information regarding transactions, including, among other things, the type of device you use,
                access times, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers.

                2.2. Information about plugins you might be using, included but not limited to those related to the
                management of cryptocurrency assets and any information provided by them.

                2.3. Your email and Ether address.

                2.4 The DCL Client requires the highest level of browser permissions that could potentially lead to
                procurement of more personal information. Information on these permissions are used for a limited purpose,
                and why this is necessary, can be found in paragraph 3 below.

                2.5 Your interactions with the Site are documented via Segment.io and that information is processed by
                Google.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">3. The Way your Personal Information is used</h3>
            <p class="p">3.1 As with nearly all interactions that take place on the World Wide Web, the servers may receive
                information by virtue of your interaction with them, including but not limited to IP Addresses.

                3.2 The DCL Client requires full browser permissions that could potentially be used to access additional
                personal information. Such browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical purpose for
                allowing the DCL Client to properly interact with your browser. No additional information is obtained beyond
                what is necessary to provide the DCL Client. No information received is shared with any third-party except
                as required for provision of the DCL Client.

                3.3 Segment.io is used for purposes of monitoring web traffic. Any identifying information collected via
                Segment.io is controlled by Segment.io, Inc.

                3.4 Public blockchains provide transparency into transactions and the Foundation is not responsible for
                preventing or managing information broadcasted on a blockchain.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">4. What Is Done With Your Information</h3>
            <p class="p">4.1 Your information may be used in the following ways:

                To analyze trends for how the Site and Tools are being used; To improve the Site and the Tools; To help
                personalize your experience of the Site and the Tools; and If you provide your contact information, you may
                receive technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts, to provide support to you, to tell you
                about other products and services that might interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions. 4.2
                Your information may be shared with third parties who need to access it in order to do work related to the
                Site and the Tools, including doing things like helping make the Site or DCL Client available, or providing
                analytics services. These third parties only access and use your information as necessary to perform their
                functions.

                4.3 Aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information may be created in a way that does not
                directly identify you. Those aggregations and anonymizations may be used or shared for a variety of purposes
                related to the Site and the DCL Client.

                4.4 Your personal information may be disclosed to agents, businesses, or service providers who process your
                personal information for providing the Site and the Tools to you. The agreements with these service
                providers limit the kinds of information they can use or process and ensure they use reasonable efforts to
                keep your personal information secure.

                4.5 The Foundation also reserves the right to disclose personal information that it believes, in good faith,
                is appropriate or necessary to enforce the Terms of Use, take precautions against liability or harm, to
                investigate and respond to third-party claims or allegations, to respond to court orders or official
                requests, to protect the security or integrity of the Site or the Tools, and to protect the rights,
                property, or safety of the Foundation, the Decentraland community of users and LAND owners, or others.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">5.Your Choice</h3>
            <p class="p">Your personal information will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and as part of
                that you will have limited or no opportunity to otherwise modify how your information is used.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">6.Cookies</h3>
            <p class="p">The Site and the Tools do not use cookies at this time but they might do so in the future, in which
                case this Privacy Policy shall be updated accordingly.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">7.Information Not Collected</h3>
            <p class="p">Any other personally-identifiable information about you shall not be collected, unless you give it
                to the Foundation directly: by filling out a form, giving written feedback, communicating via third party
                social media sites, or otherwise communicating via the Site, the Tools or any other means.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">8.Information Security</h3>
            <p class="p">Whilst neither the Foundation, nor any other organization, can guarantee the security of
                information processed online, the Foundation has appropriate security measures in place to protect your
                personal information. For example, the personal information you provide is stored on computer systems with
                limited access, encryption, or both.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">9.Privacy Rights</h3>
            <p class="p">9.1 Subject to applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights in respect of your
                personal information: (i) to obtain a copy of your personal information together with information about how
                and on what basis that personal information is processed; (ii) to rectify inaccurate personal information
                (including the right to have incomplete personal information completed); (iii) to erase your personal
                information (in limited circumstances, where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
                it was collected or processed); (iv) to restrict processing of your personal information where: a. the
                accuracy of the personal information is contested; b. the processing is unlawful but you object to the
                erasure of the personal information; or c. we no longer require the personal information but it is still
                required for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim; (v) to challenge processing which we
                have justified on the basis of a legitimate interest (as opposed to your consent, or to perform a contract
                with you); (vi) to prevent us from sending you direct marketing; (vii) to withdraw your consent to our
                processing of your personal information (where that processing is based on your consent); (viii) to object
                to decisions which are based solely on automated processing or profiling; (ix) in addition to the above, you
                have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority.

                9.2. If you reside in California, you may request certain general information regarding our disclosure of
                personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

                9.3. If you wish to investigate the exercising of any of these rights, please write to us at the following
                address: privacy@decentraland.org</p>
            <h3 class="h3">10.Changes and Updates</h3>
            <p class="p">10.1 This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the “Last update
                posted” date above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the DCL
