            <p class="p">The Decentraland Foundation (the "Foundation"), acting for the benefit of the Decentraland
                community as
                a whole, holds the intellectual property rights over, and makes available, (a) the DCL Client, the Desktop

                Agora,
                Forum, the Land Manager, the Command Line Interface, DAO, the Developersâ€™ Hub, the Rewards tool which, with
                any
                other features, tools and/or materials made available from time to time by the Foundation, are referred to
                herein as the "Tools" and (b) the website https://decentraland.org (the "Site"). Please read these Terms of
                Use
                (the "Terms" or "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Tools and the Site. By using or otherwise
                accessing
                the Tools and the Site, you: (1) accept and agree to be bound by these Terms; (2) accept that the Tools are
                still in testing phase and that you use at your own risk, as further explained in Section 2 below; (3)
                represent
                that you are old enough to use the Tools and the Site pursuant to Sections 3 and 9 below; (4) consent to the
                collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in the Privacy Policy, available
                here

                available
                here https://decentraland.org/content, and (5.2.) any additional terms and conditions of participation
                issued by
                the Foundation from time to time. If you do not agree to the Terms, then you must not access or use the
                Tools or
                the Site.

                As per the endowment received, the Foundation makes available the Tools and the Site free of charge in order
                to
                allow different interactions with the Decentraland platform ("Decentraland"), a decentralized virtual world.
                The
                Foundation does not own or control Decentraland, as ownership and governance is decentralized in the
                community
                through the DAO.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">2. Disclaimer and Modification of Terms of Use</h3>
            <p class="p">The Tools are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis and may contain defects and software
                bugs. You are advised to safeguard important data, property and content, to use caution, and not to rely in
                any
                way on the correct or secure functionality or performance of the Tools.

                Except for Section 17, providing for binding arbitration and waiver of class action rights, as detailed in
                Section 7, the Foundation reserves the right, at the sole discretion of the DAO, to modify or replace the
                Terms
                of Use at any time. The most current version of these Terms will be posted on the Site. You shall be
                responsible
                for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Tools by you after any
                modification
                to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">3.Egilibility</h3>
            <p class="p">You hereby represent and warrant that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms,
                conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in these Terms and to abide
                by
                and comply with these Terms. Decentraland is a global platform and by accessing the Content, the Site or
                Tools,
                you are representing and warranting that you are of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction as is
                required to access such Tools and Content and enter into arrangements as provided by the Tools. You further
                represent that you are otherwise legally permitted to use the Tools in your jurisdiction including owning

                is not liable for your compliance or failure to comply with such laws. You further represent and warrant
                that
                all funds or assets used by you have been lawfully obtained by you in compliance with all applicable laws.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">4.Account Access and Security</h3>
            <p class="p">Access to the Tools is provided via a third party private key manager selected by you (e.g., a Web3
                Provider, Metamask, a USB interface for Ledger Wallet, the Mist browser, or other). Security and secure
                access
                to each account in the Tools is provided solely by the third party private key manager you select to
                administer
                your private key. You and the third party private key manager you select are entirely responsible for
                security
                related to access of the Tools and all information provided by you to such third party provider (including
                without limitation, email or phone number). The DAO and/or the Foundation bear no responsibility for any
                breach
                of security or unauthorized access to your account (the "Account"). You are advised to: (a) avoid any use of
                the
                same password with your selected third party private key manager that you have ever used outside of the
                third
                party private key manager; and (b) keep your password and any related secret information secure and
                confidential
                and do not share them with anyone else.

                You are solely responsible for all activities conducted through your Account whether or not you authorize
                the
                activity. In the event that fraud, illegality or other conduct that violates this Agreement is discovered or
                reported (whether by you or someone else) that is connected with your Account, the DAO may suspend or block
                your
                Account (or Accounts) as described in Section 15.

                You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access
                to
                your devices. You are solely responsible for any harm resulting from your disclosure, or authorization of
                the
                disclosure, of your password or from any person's use of your password to gain access to your Account. You
                acknowledge that in the event of any unauthorized use of or access to your Account, password or other breach
                of
                security, you accept that due to the nature of the Tools and the platform itself, the DAO and/or the
                Foundation
                will be unable to remedy any issues that arise.

                The DAO and/or the Foundation will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal
                theory)
                to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the
                foregoing obligations, or for any reason whatsoever, except fraud on our part.</p>
